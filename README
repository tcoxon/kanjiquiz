Requires Term::ReadLine. You can get this with CPAN if it's not already
installed on your computer. Or on Ubuntu, you can install it with:
    apt-get install libterm-readline-gnu-perl

This quiz has only been tested (and is only expected to work) on GNU/Linux. I'm
willing to accept patches to make it work on other operating systems.

You might also be interested in WWWJDIC (http://wwwjdic.org/). Future versions
of this software may interface with WWWJDIC to offer additional features.

Requires a UTF-8-capable terminal.

Enter 'help' at the main prompt in Kanjiquiz (or run 'perldoc quiz.pl') for
instructions on how to use it.
