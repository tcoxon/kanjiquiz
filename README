Requires Term::ReadLine. You can get this with CPAN if it's not already
installed on your computer. Or on Ubuntu, you can install it with:
    apt-get install libterm-readline-gnu-perl

This quiz has only been tested (and is only expected to work) on GNU/Linux. I'm
willing to accept patches to make it work on other operating systems.

You might also be interested in WWWJDIC (http://wwwjdic.org/). Future versions
of this software may interface with WWWJDIC to offer additional features.

Requires a UTF-8-capable terminal.

Enter 'help' at the main prompt in Kanjiquiz (or run 'perldoc quiz.pl') for
instructions on how to use it.

TODO

Use collected stats to display graphs of progress.

Clean up and document the customgrade.pl script. At the moment,
lesson8.txt/csv is used as an example. Load it into the quiz with the load
command.
